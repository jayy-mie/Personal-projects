Project 1: game
Language: Python
Goal: to create a functional immersive game,at the same time learning the python language
type of game: fantasy, turn based
Duration: from Thursday 28/9/2023 to Thursday 30/10/2023

NB//The game does not have any plot, just the functionalities that i would want in a game
STEPS:
1. create characters and stat system
2. create classes, both primary and hybrid
3. create elements for moves
4. create enemy types and classes
5. create system where enemy encounters would choose different enemy types and numbers
6. create a fight system
7. items
8.systems outside of battle
 
1. create characters and stat system
- for demo, will focus on 4, main character,knight, mage, thief.
- stat system will be used to measure attack power, health, defense, speed(who makes the first move and when)
- stat system will also include an exp system, which determines when characters level-up, and will increase/decrease depending on enemy level and encounter size
- rewards(stat and class points) will be a set number per level-up, but there will be ways of gaining class points outside of level-ups (to be intergrated later))

2.create classes, both primary and hybrid

- These classes are for the player character and companion characters.
- Player character will have access to all classes, but will have limited points to hinder investing in all of them and direct the player towards making specialized builds.
- Companion characters will have access to 3 pre-determined classes, depending on their role.
- These classes will determine character stat, depending on specialization, and will determin how many points a character gets per level-up.

3.create elements for moves

- fire, water, wind, earth, light, dark, plant, ice, lightning,  no element- physical, magical,status moves
- fire: 2x strong against ice, plant, weak against: earth, water, specializes in damage over time
- water: 2x strong against fire, lightning, weak against: plant, ice, specializes in increasing evasiveness
- wind: 2x strong against plant, earth, weak against:fire, ice, specializes in increasing speed
- earth: 2x strong against water, lightning, weak against wind, ice, specializes in defence
- light: 2x strong against darkness, plant, weak against fire, lightning, specializes in healing and buffing teammates
- darkness: 2x strong against light, ice, weak against wind, earth, specializes in debilitating opponents
- plant: 2x strong against water, earth, weak against fire, wind, specializes in elemental barriers and making opponents weak to other elements
- ice: 2x strong against water, earth, weak to fire, lightning, specializes in decreasing opponent accuracy and freezing oppoonents
- lightning: 2x strong against water, ice, weak to earth, light, specializes in random attacks using lightning and random chance for opponent to miss turn(stun)

4.create enemy types and classes

- either by location / by element
- enemies to work off same rules as player
- have unique moveset for beast like enemies and similar moveset to player characters for humanoid opponents
- set hp & mp, stats and innate element for beast type monsters
- set unique strengths and weaknesses for boss monsters

5.create system where enemy encounters would choose different enemy types and numbers

- random / overworld encounters?
- max 5, min 1
- different classes of enemies (fighter, archer, mage, beast e.t.c)
- different enemies depending on location
- exp reward, to increase/ decrease in proportion to level difference, item reward, purely either consumables or crafting items

6. create a fight system

- turn-based
- ability to add/remove turns on each character
- speed of a character determines turn position

7.items

- types (weapons, consumables, miscellaneous, armor, materials, augments)
- different weapon types (staffs, greatswords, daggers, shields, )
- different armor types (hoods, knight sets, robes, shirts, shields)
- different consumable types (heals hp/mp, damage items, stat boosters(only work in battle))
- augments (items equipped aside from weapons/ armor that increase stats outside of strength & defence, and rewards)
- miscellaneous items (smithing items, alchemy items, crafting items, junk)

8.systems outside of battle

- shops (smiths, alchemy shops, general stores, black markets(for rare items),)
- item creation and upgrades(smiths, magic schools)
- bounties (to create money out of fighting)
